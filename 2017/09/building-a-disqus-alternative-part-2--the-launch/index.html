    <h1 class="title">Building a Disqus alternative Part 2 : The launch</h1> 
    <div class="content">
      <p>I finally launched <a href="https://www.hostedcomments.com/">Hosted Comments</a>!</p>

<p>After 3 weeks of development, I finally have the first version up and running. You can scroll to the bottom of this page and see it in action.</p>

<p>My initial plan was to blog about the process of building Hosted Comments, but I think I am going to skip the part 1, part 2 style in favour of standalone posts talking about specific challenges of building this software.</p>

<p>So what’s changed since the last post?</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>I launched!</strong> The basic functionality is up : adding a website, embedding a small code snippet to add comments to the website, and the actual commenting itself works pretty well. Adding, editing, deleting and replying to comments works. There is also a reddit style voting system. In terms of feature parity with Disqus, a few important pieces are missing : email alerts for comment related notifications, replying to comments by email, anonymous posting of comments and social login. There are also areas that I plan to significantly improve : the look and feel of the website, the moderation tools and optimizations for improved performance. Since this is just an MVP, I decided to leave out the mentioned features. There is also no payment processing built in and will only be added if I manage to get to a point where manually sending invoices becomes a pain.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing</strong> I heard a lot of complaints about pricing while talking to potential customers and decided to make the plans more generous. $29/month for 1 million pageviews and $99/month for 5 million pageviews. I believe this is more palatable for potential cutomers. I am also planning to introduce a $10/month tier for 200,000 pageviews. Since a commenting system is not exactly viewed as a critical part of a website, I guess I have to lower the prices significantly.</p>

<p><strong>Closed source code</strong> I’ve kept the code closed source. This is obviously a controversial topic, but weighing out the pros and cons in my specific case, I decided to keep it closed source.</p>

<p><strong>Sales</strong> : No sales yet. No surprises here. I am in discussions with potential customers and learned a few interesting use cases of my platform. People want to integrate a commenting system into existing products using an api. Eg- Managing accounts for users of niche blogging software. I did not consider the possibility that people might want to integrate my comments system using an api!</p>

<p><strong>Marketing activites</strong> : as of now it’s limited to personal outreach and blogging. I received an interesting suggestion about building a tool to compare performance vs Disqus. It’s something I’ll explore in the future. Paid advertising is also something I&rsquo;m exploring. Since I have no clue about how to run a campaign, I&rsquo;ll have to explore paid channels carefully and be prepared to not make any ROI in the beginning.</p>

<p>I started using the commenting platform on this site and it works great so far.</p>

<p><strong>Important lessons that I learned</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Talking to users, I learned surprising things from them that I did not consider. Eg- People wanted an API, Single Sign On etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Sending cold emails is hard since a majority of them go unanswered and the few responses are &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been in talks with potential customers and the turn around time is days to weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>SaaS expectations : interacting with successful SaaS owners, there&rsquo;s been one truth that I found particularly brutal : building any SaaS to even a few hundred MRR takes atleast 6 months on average and along the way I might just find out that this project has no future. All the stories about some guy reaching $10k MRR with minimal effort are called outliers for a reason.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since I am in beta right now I am not yet charging users, feel free to try out the platform and let me know you think.</p>
